1. a2

2. 0x000000000000000e and 0x0000000000000000

3. 0x34

4. 0x30

5. since 57616 is 0xe110, and 0x00646c72 in ascii is "rld\0", so the print result is "He110 World".

If the RISC-V were instead big-endian, the 'i' will be set as 4321, that is, 0x10e.

6. the printf function will load register 'a2' as the parameter "y=%d".
